---

### STEP 7: CONFIGURE BOT

You no longer need to edit Python files! The bot uses a secure `.env` file for your core keys.

#### 7.1 Create the .env File
In your bot folder, create a file named exactly `.env` (don't forget the dot!) and add these keys:

```env
# 1. CORE SECURITY
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqr_STUvwxyz
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://admin:password@cluster.mongodb.net/bot_db
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=123456789
ADMIN_USERNAME=@YourAdminHandle

# 2. GLOBAL DISPLAY (Optional)
BOT_NAME="Premium Membership Bot"
MERCHANT_NAME="Premium Service"


 ### STEP 8: RUN BOT

 #### Method A: Cloud Deployment (Recommended)
You can deploy this bot 24/7 for free using Koyeb or Railway!
1. Push your code to a private GitHub repository.
2. Log into [Koyeb](https://app.koyeb.com) or [Railway](https://railway.app).
3. Connect your GitHub and select the bot repository.
4. **Important:** Change the deployment type to **Worker** (Background Task).
5. Add your `.env` variables into the platform's Environment Variables tab.
6. Click Deploy!

#### METHOD B: (Automated)

```bash
# Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup
./setup.sh
```

This will:
1. ✅ Check Docker installation
2. ✅ Create necessary directories
3. ✅ Build Docker image
4. ✅ Start the bot
5. ✅ Show status

#### 8.2 Manual Setup (Alternative)

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p data logs

# Build Docker image
docker-compose build

# Start bot
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

---

### STEP 9: VERIFY BOT IS RUNNING

#### 9.1 Check Docker Status

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Should show:
```
NAME                    STATUS
semi_auto_membership_bot   Up X seconds
```

#### 9.2 Check Logs

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Semi-Automatic Bot Started!
💳 Payment: UPI (No Gateway Fees)
✅ Verification: Manual by Admin

```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop viewing logs.

3. Bot should create invite link
4. User should receive the link

#### 10.5 Test Invite Link

1. Click the invite link
2. You should be able to join the channel

### 📝 3. Add the "Admin Dashboard" Section
Right after **STEP 10**, add this brand new section explaining your new SaaS features:

```markdown
## 🎛️ STEP 11: THE IN-APP ADMIN DASHBOARD

You don't need to touch any code to manage your bot! Send `/admin` to your bot on Telegram to open the interactive control panel.

From here you can:
* **📢 Set Premium Channel:** Forward a message from your private channel to instantly link it to the bot.
* **🏦 Manage UPI:** Add, delete, or rotate multiple UPI IDs dynamically.
* **📋 Manage Plans:** Create 1-month, 6-month, or Lifetime plans with custom prices without touching code!
* **💬 Edit Messages:** Change the Welcome message, Approval text, or Default Image using Telegram's built-in formatting.
* **💳 Gateway Setup:** Add Razorpay API keys and toggle between "Manual" and "Auto-Approve" modes.

After editing:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Change Price

Edit `config.py`:
```python
```

Restart:
```bash
docker-compose restart
```
